<p> The transistor is a fundamental building block of both digital and analog circuits. So...what is a transistor? 


<br>
<br>

A resistor is a circuit element with two terminals. A capacitor is a circuit element with two terminals. A diode is a circuit element with two terminals. 

<br>
<br>
>> A transistor is a device with three terminals (can have more).
<br>
>> A transistor is an electronic switch in digital circuits. 
<br>
>> A transistor is an electronic amplifier in analog circuits. 
<br>
<br>


That's pretty much all there is to it. Understanding this will take you a long way. So let's first explore what we mean by switches and amplifiers. 

<br>
<br>
<u style="color: #FFA500;">Electronic Switch</u>
<br>
<br>

An electronic switch allows you to connect two nodes in a circuit using a third, electronic control node. This control node is typically controlled using a voltage or a current. The best way to understand this is to compare it to its mechanical counterpart. A mechanical switch allows one to switch between two nodes using a third control node which is actuated by a mechanical force. 
<br>
<br>
A key on your keyboard is an example of a mechanical switch. When you press a key, a connection is made between two nodes of a circuit. Note, a mechanical force is used to control the switch. The mechanical force in this case is your finger pressing on the key. The light switch in your house is also a mechanical switch. Pressing on the switch allows you to toggle between LIGHT ON and LIGHT OFF states. </p>

<p>Okay. So we now understand what an electronic switch is. It should be clear why an electronic switch is advantageous. If one wants to toggle a switch using an "electrical force" -> (voltage, current), an electronic switch can be used. A mechanical force is not required,  and switching between states (say from ON to OFF) can be done quite quickly by making electrons move from one place to another. Transistors allow us to do this.

<br>
<br>
<u style="color: #FFA500;">Electronic Amplifiers</u>

<p>You are in your car. You connect your phone to your infotainment system. The volume of the track you have selected to play is quite low. You want to increase the volume. What do you do? You turn a knob and the speaker outputs the same track at a higher volume level. What is happening in this system? An electronic amplifier is amplifying your audio signal.

<br>
<br>
An audio signal can be represented as a voltage or current signal. When an input signal is applied to an amplifier, it generates an output that is a scalar multiple of the input. For example, an amplifier with a gain of 2 (scalar multiple factor = gain of amplifier), will output a signal that is 2x the input signal. When you turn the volume knob in your car, you are mechanically tuning the gain of an amplifier. Lower volumes correspond to a low gain amplifier. Higher volumes correspond to a higher gain amplifier. We can use transistors to build such amplifiers.
